This repo contains all of the keycaps that I've designed.
I've included parameterized fusion360 files that anyone is free to edit.

# Lever Keycaps
Demo video: https://vimeo.com/897496865

## Switch compatibility
Choc: tested and compatible with choc v1.
MX: currently only tested and working with Outemu Lemon/Lime switches. If your MX switch has a different stem mount, these may not be compatible!
If you use a different switch, you will need to reference the datasheet for your switch, note the pre-travel distance and change the "heel" parameter accordingly.
    
## Notes
- These keycaps will make your switches feel lighter due to leverage. A heavier switch may actually feel better than a lighter one.
- They will alter the actuation distance. You can adjust the parameters to increase or decrease the actuation distance.
- I tried my best to parameterize things, but my sketches are not perfect. Double check the sketches and bodies after changing parameters.

## Hardware and tools required 
Hinge: dressmaker pin with 0.7mm shaft diameter. A box of 350 goes for $4-5 in a brick and mortar store. The exact model used was dritz #22, size 20 (1 Â¼") nickel plated steel. it's a little more expensive on amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003W0TIH6/
You can use other materials for the hinge and change the hole parameters as needed.
Flush cutters: to trim the excess hinge
Optional: tweezer pliers for grabbing and inserting the hinge

## Slicer settings (PLA)
Placeholder. I will upload the 3mf file containing the slicer settings. The supports need to be dialed in correctly or the overhangs will sag.

Supports

## Assembly
Simply print, remove mouse ears, line up the holes of the base and the paddle, slot the hinge through the holes, and flush cut the excess hinge. Push the assembly onto switch. It should snap into place.

## Troubleshooting
Depending on your printer's tolerances, you may need to adjust the size of the holes and/or the tolerance value. 
Personally, I leverage the walls of my keyboard case to secure the pin in place. A dab of superglue works as well.

# Cylindrical Low Profile
1U keycaps with concavity along the y axis. Designed specifically for thumb usage. Inspired by MCC keycap profile.
Currently only has mx compatibility, but the source file can easily be edited to support choc or other switches.

# Cylindrical Low Profile Choc v2
Thumb: a cross between CS T1 and MCC. Slight concavity for homing thumbs with an asymmetrical shape designed for horizontal thumb combo comfort.
Currently choc v2/lofree/mx compatible.
